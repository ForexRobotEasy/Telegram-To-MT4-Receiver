# Telegram To MT4 Receiver

This is a sample code for a Telegram to MT4 receiver, developed by the Forex Robot Easy Team. It allows users to receive trading signals from Telegram channels directly into their MT4 platform.

## How it works

The code uses the TelegramAPI library to connect to Telegram and start receiving signals. It requires a Telegram bot token and a chat ID to function properly. Users need to replace the `YOUR_TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` and `chatID` variables with their own credentials.

The code provides customizable settings to enable or disable certain features. Users can choose to enable or disable signal copying, copy signals from multiple channels, copy signals from private channels, and copy signals from restricted channels.

The code initializes the Telegram API, sets the chat ID, and connects to Telegram to start receiving signals. It then processes the received signals and performs trade and position management based on the user's logic.

The code also includes functions for trade monitoring and tick logic.
